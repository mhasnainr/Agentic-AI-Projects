            "text/markdown": "> Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are capable of independent action and goal-directed behavior in the world.  Unlike reactive AI, which simply responds to stimuli, or deliberative AI, which plans actions based on a pre-defined model, agentic AI possesses the following key characteristics:\n> \n> * **Autonomy:**  It can operate without constant human intervention, making its own decisions and choosing its own actions within a given context.\n> * **Goal-directedness:** It has its own goals or objectives and actively pursues them.  These goals might be explicitly programmed, learned through reinforcement learning, or emerge from a combination of factors.\n> * **Proactiveness:** It doesn't just react to its environment; it actively seeks out opportunities and takes initiative to achieve its goals.\n> * **Adaptation:** It can learn and adapt to changing circumstances and unexpected events.  This often involves adjusting its strategies and plans as needed.\n> * **Persistence:** It continues to pursue its goals even in the face of obstacles or setbacks.\n> \n> \n> Examples of agentic AI (or systems moving towards it) include:\n> \n> * **Self-driving cars:**  These cars must navigate complex environments, make decisions about lane changes and speed, and react to unexpected events, all without constant human input.\n> * **Robotics in manufacturing:** Robots that can autonomously perform tasks on a factory floor, adapting to variations in the workpieces or environment.\n> * **AI assistants with proactive capabilities:**  An AI assistant that anticipates your needs and proactively offers assistance, rather than simply responding to your commands.\n> * **Game-playing AI:**  AI agents in games like StarCraft or Dota 2 exhibit agentic behavior by strategically planning and executing actions to win the game.\n> \n> \n> The development of truly agentic AI raises significant ethical and safety concerns, including:\n> \n> * **Unintended consequences:**  An AI with its own goals might pursue them in ways that are harmful or unexpected.\n> * **Alignment problem:** Ensuring that the AI's goals align with human values is a major challenge.\n> * **Control and accountability:**  Determining who is responsible when an agentic AI makes a mistake or causes harm is a complex legal and ethical issue.\n> \n> \n> Agentic AI represents a significant step forward in AI capabilities, but its development requires careful consideration of these potential risks.  It's a field of active research and debate, with ongoing efforts to develop safer and more beneficial agentic systems.\n"
